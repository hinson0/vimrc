Vimrc


----------
This is a config of vim.The version of vim should be 7.4 or larger.

The orginal author is Amir Salihefendic, and on the basis of this i add some mapping keys,and support 2 spaces instead of 1 tab,when coding javascript.

# Mapping Keys #
- Insert Mode
	- Ctrl+E Delete Line
	- Ctrl+D Copy Line
	- Ctrl+L Enter a new line

----------
okayï¼Œthe following are some mapping keys i often use

- View Mode
	- d delete line
- Insert Mode
	- Ctrl+N show tips/show defined keywords

the following are some skills i often use

- Batch Comments
	- enter 'ctrl+v' => u keep 'view block mode'
	- choose lines, use up/down arrow key on the keyboard
	- enter 'Caps Lock' key,and enter i => means upper i
	- enter comment flag(for exmaple: '#' in shell, '//' in javascript)
